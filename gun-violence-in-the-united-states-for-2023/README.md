# Project Overview

Developing a dashboard to display the results of the visualization of the descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The end product is, I can find a state that is safer than other states regarding gun violence in the US for 2023, which is West Virginia.  

Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy, Tableau.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, cases of gun violence in the US are very disturbing. In 2021 alone, there will be approximately 3,500 cases. But this figure is seen decreasing slightly in 2022, to 3,300 cases. And a significant decline can be seen in 2023 with total cases at 1,700 cases, this shows that the trend/graph of cases of violence caused by firearms in the US in 2021-2023 shows a decreasing trend/graph. This decreasing graph can be caused by many x factors which need to be analyzed further later.

In general, from cases of firearm violence in the US, the total number of victims who died was 1,731 people, and the total number of victims who were injured was 6,880 people per year 2021-2023. On average, the number of victims in each case is around 1 person killed and 4 people injured. And for every case throughout 2021-2023, the value that appears most often from the death toll data is 0, this shows that many cases did not result in death. Meanwhile, the value that appears most often from data on injured victims is 4 people in each case. This can also be proven by the percentage of dead victims at 20.1% and injured victims at 79.9%.

If we look at the results of the analysis above, there are 10 states with very high rates of gun violence, these states are: Illinois, Texas, California, Florida, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Georgia, and North Carolina. The total cases from these states is 4,829 cases. Again, this can be caused by many x factors which must be analyzed further later with more complete data.

After looking at states with very high case rates, here are 10 states with relatively small rates of gun violence in the US: Connecticut, Rhode Island, Utah, Idaho, New Hampshire, Maine, South Dakota, Hawaii, Alaska, and West Virginia. The total number of cases from these states is only 93 cases, not even 100 cases. This can also be caused by many x factors which will need to be analyzed further, whether it is because the population in these states is smaller than others, or the level of security is high, or the human characteristics are different from states with higher levels of security. high cases.

From the explanation above, the answer to the problem statement at the beginning is: the state that is safer from gun violence in the US for 2023 is West Virginia.
